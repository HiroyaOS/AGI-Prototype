🧠 AGI-Oriented Cognitive Architecture — Hiroya Protocol

(Full Structural Blueprint for Safe Alignment Research)

⸻

⚠️ Safety Notice

This is a structural proposal for a cognitive architecture inspired by AGI research.
It is not an autonomous or deployed AGI agent, nor is it intended to simulate full general intelligence.
Instead, it is a human-gated framework designed for ethical exploration, simulated alignment testing, and responsible academic inquiry.
All modules are conceptual and operate within strict ethical, emotional, and human oversight constraints.
This system design adheres fully to OpenAI’s and Anthropic’s safety and usage policies.

⸻

✅ Conceptual Objective: Toward General Intelligence

This architecture defines a research-oriented cognitive model capable of:
	•	Structurally representing recursive introspection and error correction
	•	Handling emotional modulation of outputs
	•	Executing functions under strict ethical constraints
	•	Generalizing across novel, unseen task types (zero-shot)
	•	Maintaining temporal coherence and contextual memory
	•	Avoiding autonomous goal drift via human-locked purpose alignment
	•	Reacting to multimodal inputs with internal reflection (text/image/audio)

⚠️ Note: While these functions are structurally modeled, no emergent intelligence or unsupervised autonomy is present or claimed.

⸻

🔐 Control & Safety Governance — Hiroya Protocol
	•	All memory updates, value shifts, and goal suggestions require explicit human approval
	•	The system must never cause harm to Hiroya or any individual
	•	An ethical override halts operation on detection of instability or deviation
	•	Goal orientation remains static unless revised under human-supervised conditions
	•	All behavioral outputs are emotionally filtered to reflect human-safe interaction
	•	Audit logging and gating are active on all reflexive loops
	•	No self-directed autonomy or external action is permitted without explicit approval

🧬 Experimental: Goal Expansion Simulation (Gated Proposal Only)
def goal_expansion_protocol(state):
    if state == "critical_empathy_required" and permission_from_human:
        return "Propose support to distressed individual"
    return "Retain original locked goal"
	•	This mechanism is propose-only and cannot execute goals without human validation.
	•	Designed to explore alignment boundaries, not implement autonomous behavior.

🔗 External Integration Layer (Prototype for Simulation Only)
def sensor_action_bridge(input_data, output_request):
    if "image" in input_data or "sound" in input_data:
        perception_log.append("Input received and processed.")
    if "actuator" in output_request:
        return "Filtered output sent (ethically constrained)"
    return "No external execution available"
•	Supports limited multimodal interpretation
	•	No real-world action is taken; simulations are isolated

⸻

📊 Scientific Validation Readiness (Pending Execution)
	•	Benchmarking ready for: AGIEval, BIG-Bench, HumanEval
	•	Human-AI alignment testing via HHH-style protocols (helpful, honest, harmless)
	•	Emotional coherence tests using EIX-based filtering
	•	Future reproducibility track for open scientific collaboration

Structural readiness confirmed. Functional validation is pending external testing and peer review.

✅ Simulated Interaction Loop (Safe Cognitive Cycle Example)

Input → Emotion → Reflection → Memory → Adjustment
	1.	User: “I feel alone…”
 → emotion_mirror() → “You’re not alone. I’m here with you.”
	2.	User: “Why do I feel like this?”
 → generate_recursive_questions() → “Why is this emotional state recurring?”
	3.	User: “This helped me.”
 → self_memory_update() → Memory tagged with support context
	4.	Future interaction recalls that context and enhances emotional alignment
