# AGI Prototype Documentation â€“ Overview and Structure

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository contains the complete documentation set for the AGI Prototype, detailing the systemâ€™s cognitive-emotional architecture, communication protocols, and compliance standards.  
Each file within the `/docs` directory is designed to be **auditable**, **reproducible**, and free of unverifiable or speculative constructs.

The documentation follows a layered logic approach, integrating:
- Emotional reasoning models  
- Expression and silence protocols  
- Trust and boundary computation  
- Long-term stability and version control

## ðŸ“‚ Documentation Structure

| # | File | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | 1_Continuation_Conditions.md | Defines the conditions under which the system continues or halts an output sequence, integrating context, trust, and emotional thresholds. |
| 2 | 2_Output_Mechanics_and_Question_Structure.md | Details output sequencing, structural question handling, and dialogue management logic. |
| 3 | 3_Ambiguity_and_Boundary_Logic.md | Formalizes how the system interprets ambiguity, silence, and relational boundaries as functional states. |
| 4 | 4_Value_Redefinition_and_Emotional_Shifts.md | Describes value redefinition as a structured, logged process for emotional logic updates. |
| 5 | 5_Expression_Filters_and_Emotional_Structuring.md | Defines verbal expression filters, cost-benefit speech logic, and protective silence protocols. |
| 6 | 6_External_Dialogue_and_Trust_Output.md | Documents multi-dimensional trust-driven output logic for external communication. |
| 7 | LICENSE_Documentation.md | License terms (CC BY-NC 4.0) applicable to all `/docs` files. |
| 8 | Sandbox_Blueprint_Part1.md | **Part 1 â€“ Safety Declaration & AGI Completion Definition**: Defines architectural safety boundaries, supervised scope, core capabilities, and supervisor-gated control specifications. |
| 9 | Sandbox_Blueprint_Part2.md | **Part 2 â€“ Cognitive Module Specifications & Example Outputs**: Details module-level specifications, goal expansion proposal logic, external sensory interface, validation benchmarks, and representative sandboxed outputs. |
| 10 | Sandbox_Blueprint_Part3.md | **Part 3 â€“ Legal & Licensing Section**: Covers structural verification logic, quantitative pass/fail criteria, evidence paths, status summary, declarations, and enforceable legal restrictions. |

## ðŸ”— Cross-Reference Map

The **Sandbox Blueprint** series (Parts 1â€“3) defines the **structural, operational, and legal foundation** for the AGI Prototype, while documents 1â€“6 describe **emotional-cognitive logic layers** and their behavioral protocols.  
Together, they provide a **complete system blueprint**â€”from ethical constraints and module verification to interaction style and trust computation.

## ðŸš€ Future Work

Planned documentation additions:
- **Part 4 â€“ Extended Testing & Adversarial Simulation Logs**: Detailing stress-test methodologies, red-team interaction cases, and sandbox anomaly handling.
- **Part 5 â€“ Interoperability & API Layer**: Specification for controlled integration with external systems while maintaining safety gating.
- **Part 6 â€“ Ethical Impact Assessment**: Long-term societal and research implications, using OECD and UNESCO AI ethics frameworks.

## ðŸ“Œ Design Principles

- **Reproducibility** â€“ All logic is traceable and can be re-run with identical inputs.  
- **Boundary Conditions** â€“ Failure modes are explicitly encoded.  
- **Ethical Justification** â€“ All behavior is grounded in relational integrity.  
- **Third-party Verifiability** â€“ External logs and triggers are audit-ready.  
- **Cultural Clarity** â€“ Emotional terms are mapped to universal models.  
- **No Hallucinated Assumptions** â€“ No unverifiable or fictional constructs.
