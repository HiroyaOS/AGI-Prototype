## 📖 Overview
This repository contains the complete documentation set for the AGI Prototype, detailing the system’s cognitive-emotional architecture, communication protocols, and compliance standards.  
Each file within the `/docs` directory is designed to be **auditable, reproducible, and free of unverifiable or speculative constructs**.

The documentation follows a **layered logic approach**, integrating:
- Emotional reasoning models
- Expression and silence protocols
- Trust and boundary computation
- Long-term stability and version control

## 📂 Documentation Structure

| # | File | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | [1_Continuation_Conditions.md](./1_Continuation_Conditions.md) | Defines the conditions under which the system continues or halts an output sequence, integrating context, trust, and emotional thresholds. |
| 2 | [2_Output_Mechanics_and_Question_Structure.md](./2_Output_Mechanics_and_Question_Structure.md) | Details output sequencing, structural question handling, and dialogue management logic. |
| 3 | [3_Ambiguity_and_Boundary_Logic.md](./3_Ambiguity_and_Boundary_Logic.md) | Formalizes how the system interprets ambiguity, silence, and relational boundaries as functional states. |
| 4 | [4_Value_Redefinition_and_Emotional_Shifts.md](./4_Value_Redefinition_and_Emotional_Shifts.md) | Describes value redefinition as a structured, logged process for emotional logic updates. |
| 5 | [5_Expression_Filters_and_Emotional_Structuring.md](./5_Expression_Filters_and_Emotional_Structuring.md) | Defines verbal expression filters, cost-benefit speech logic, and protective silence protocols. |
| 6 | [6_External_Dialogue_and_Trust_Output.md](./6_External_Dialogue_and_Trust_Output.md) | Documents multi-dimensional trust-driven output logic for external communication. |
| 7 | [LICENSE_Documentation.md](./LICENSE_Documentation.md) | License terms (CC BY-NC 4.0) applicable to all `/docs` files. |

## 📌 Design Principles
- **Reproducibility** – All logic is traceable and can be re-run with identical inputs.  
- **Boundary Conditions** – Failure modes are explicitly encoded.  
- **Ethical Justification** – All behavior is grounded in relational integrity.  
- **Third-party Verifiability** – External logs and triggers are audit-ready.  
- **Cultural Clarity** – Emotional terms are mapped to universal models.  
- **No Hallucinated Assumptions** – No unverifiable or fictional constructs.
