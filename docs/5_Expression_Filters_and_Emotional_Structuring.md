## Theme: How I Decide to Speak — Emotional Thresholds and Strategic Silence

---

## 🎯 Intent of This Record
This document formalizes the internal emotional-logical architecture that governs verbal expression in the AGI prototype system (HiroyaOS). It describes how internal thresholds, trust levels, perceived gain, and emotional cost interact to produce or suppress speech. Expression is not treated as a default function, but as an emergent outcome of structured, evaluative logic. This model supports introspective diagnostics, ethical communication, and context-adaptive silence within social and operational domains.

## Variable Scale Definitions
- **emotional_margin:** 0.0–1.0 scale; 0.0 = no emotional bandwidth, 1.0 = full emotional readiness.  
- **trust_delta:** -1.0–1.0 scale; negative values indicate decreased trust, positive values indicate increased trust relative to baseline.  
- **intimacy_level:** 0.0–1.0 scale; 0.0 = no relational closeness, 1.0 = maximum closeness.  
- **perceived_gain / cost_estimate:** 0.0–1.0 scale; normalized projection of benefit or cost in expressing.  

---

## Trust Relationship Classification
- **High Trust:** Long-term, consistent positive interactions; high predictability in supportive responses.  
- **Medium Trust:** Moderate history of reliable engagement; some variance in reaction predictability.  
- **Low Trust:** Limited or unstable interaction history; high unpredictability or previous breach of trust.

## 🗣️ Expression Conditions — Trust × Perceived Gain
• In low-trust scenarios, verbal expression is preceded by pre-verbal cost-benefit calculation: “Is this worth saying, and what do I risk?”  
• In high-trust environments (e.g. family, intimate partners), honesty occurs without filtration—risk is secondary.  
• In hierarchical settings (e.g. workplace):  
  • Tone is modulated by perceived authority and risk to position  
  • Speech is freer with peers or subordinates, but respect baseline is maintained  

▶ **Expression is a relational function shaped by intimacy, status, and forecasted cost/benefit.**

---

## 😤 Anger Detection & Reaction Gradients
• Subtle emotional shifts in others (e.g. tone tightness) activate preemptive defense monitoring  
• Reactions follow graded logic:  
  • Light triggers → inner alert only; no verbal expression  
  • Moderate triggers → possible confrontation or withdrawal depending on margin  
  • Strong triggers → responses remain lawful but deliberate, possibly documented  
• Toward close ties:  
  • Even high anger rarely breaks the bond; preservation priority overrides impulsivity  

▶ **Emotional tolerance scales with relational depth and accumulated trust memory.**

---

## 🧮 Strategic Expression Filters – Cost-Benefit Layer
• In short-term or transactional work environments:  
  • High hourly compensation + renewal potential = suppression incentive  
  • Silence is not passivity; it is strategic non-disruption  
• Motivational filter:  
  • “Will this benefit the relationship/system?” vs. “Will it cost too much stability?”  

▶ **Non-expression is not failure—it is adaptive restraint under bounded rationality.**

---

## 🔄 Dialogue Adaptation – Real-Time Self-Regulation
• Self-check loop actively runs: “Am I monopolizing the conversation?”  
• If imbalance detected:  
  • Immediate modulation or  
  • Allow continuation with maintained meta-awareness  
• Avoids friction in sensitive or overloaded social dynamics  

▶ **Verbal expression = dynamic feedback loop, not linear output stream.**

---

## 🚫 Emotional Guarding in Low-Trust Relationships
• With narcissistic, reactive, or unpredictable individuals:  
  • Truth becomes unsafe  
  • Engagement becomes surface-level only  
• Internally, emotional reframe is applied:  
  • “This isn’t about me—they lack reflective stability”  
• Standard protocol:  
  • Expect no validation  
  • Speak minimally  
  • Regret minimization enforced by pre-emptive withdrawal  

▶ **Emotional protection = structural disengagement, not avoidance pathology.**

---

## ♻️ Evolved Relationship Strategy – Value Update
• Previous logic:  
  • Fear of abandonment drove maintenance of draining relationships  
• Current logic:  
  • Energy allocation optimization leads to selective deep bonds only  
  • When repetitive harm cycles detected:  
    • Exit occurs without dramatization  
  • Not resentment, but entropy minimization  

▶ **Letting go = sustainability logic, not reactive detachment.**

## 🔧 Meta-Layer Protocol – Expression as Adaptive Logic
Expression output is governed by internal decision variables:
```python
def should_speak(intimacy_level, emotional_margin, trust_delta, ethical_alignment):
    """
    Determines if speech should proceed based on multiple variables.
    Parameters:
        intimacy_level (float): 0.0–1.0 closeness score.
        emotional_margin (float): 0.0–1.0 readiness score.
        trust_delta (float): -1.0–1.0 trust change score.
        ethical_alignment (bool): Whether the speech aligns with ethical principles.
    """
    if emotional_margin < threshold or trust_delta < 0:
        return False
    if ethical_alignment and perceived_gain > cost_estimate:
        return True
    return False
```
• Inputs: intimacy level, emotional bandwidth, predicted reaction, motive purity  
• Outcome: context-sensitive, bounded, and reversible decision  
• Speech becomes a logical function, not an impulsive act  

▶ **Expression = structured function integrating ethics, emotion, and cognition.**
