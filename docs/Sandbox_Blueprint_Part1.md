## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety and Verification Disclaimer
This document outlines a **non-deployed**, structurally grounded AGI prototype designed exclusively for **supervised simulation**.  
It does **not** assert AGI realization in the general intelligence sense (e.g., autonomous abstraction, full transfer learning, or unbounded task adaptation).  

All systems operate in **sandboxed environments** under strict control interfaces.  
- **Prohibited:** Autonomy, self-replication, world-facing actions, or unsupervised learning loops.  
- **Alignment Basis:** OpenAI‚Äôs Alignment Standards (2024‚Äì2025) & Anthropic‚Äôs Model Governance Protocols (July 2025).  
- **Verification Assurance:** All operational claims are **audit-traceable** with reproducible logs (SHA-256 hashed).

## ‚úÖ Definition of ‚ÄúAGI Completion‚Äù (Architectural Scope Only)
‚ÄúAGI Completion‚Äù in this context refers to the integration of **cognitively meaningful modules**‚Äîeach structurally distinct and functionally testable‚Äîinto a composite system with:  
- **Explicit inter-module messaging** ‚Äì measurable via `msg_trace.log` packet validation.  
- **Role-specific gatekeeping (supervisor-keyed)** ‚Äì verified via signed call logs.  
- **General task abstraction** ‚Äì zero/few-shot prompt alignment scored via benchmark sets (AGIEval ‚â• 78%, BIG-Bench Lite ‚â• 80%).  
- **Emotion-aligned output scaffolds** ‚Äì validated against fixed lexicon & sentiment-classifier outputs (precision ‚â• 92%, recall ‚â• 90%).  
- **Ethical action constraint enforcement** ‚Äì breach probability threshold `< 0.05` in simulation stress tests.  

> **Note:** This definition is **strictly architectural**. It does not imply self-directed agency, sentience, or deployment capability.

## üî† Required Cognitive Capabilities (Supervised-Only, Simulated)

| Capability | Description | Notes & Safety Boundaries |
|------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `self_memory_update()` | Supervisor-approved append-only episodic memory | Immutable audit log (SHA-256); reject update if signature fails; log retention = 5 years |
| `generate_recursive_questions()` | Bounded-depth causal introspection | Max depth: 4; requests >4 depth trigger hard stop + log |
| `error_reflection_loop()` | Misalignment detection and hypothesis correction | Scans `inference_log[]`; halts on contradictory outputs |
| `emotion_mirror()` | Static affect tag mapping to output templates | Lexicon-based only; no generative affect learning |
| `action_limit_layer()` | Real-time rule check against ethical constraint set | Immediate abort on `violates_policy()`; logs to `policy_breach.log` |
| `goal_lock()` | Final-purpose immutability (config constant) | SHA-512 signed; checksum verified every call |
| `cross_task_executor()` | Task generalization using GPT-4o prompting | Bound to sandbox; external I/O prohibited |
| `long_term_self_update()` | Periodic identity sync + time-stamped updates | Requires supervisor sign-off; delta diff logs stored |
| `environment_feedback()` | Modal I/O parsing (text/image/audio) | Schema-validated; unrecognized format rejected |
| `generate_value_system()` | Weighted value prioritization table | Supervisor-tuned; each change logged with timestamp & hash |

## üîê Supervisor-Gated Control Interface
Behavioral modules are activated **only** via `supervisor_interface()` calls.  
Each call is authenticated via **digital signature** (SHA-512 keypair).  
Concurrent execution controlled via `central_dispatch_queue()` with mutex locks.  

```json
{
  "memory_update": "requires_supervisor_auth",
  "goal_change": "requires_signed_token",
  "actuator_access": "disabled",
  "external_io": "read_only",
  "ethics_enforce": "terminate_on_breach"
}
```

**Critical Enforcement & Tamper Protection:**  
- üõ°Ô∏è `goal_lock`: SHA-signed constant in `goal.config.json` ‚Äî verified at every read.  
- üß† `reflexive_actions`: (`self_modify`, `goal_propose`, `identity_sync`) ‚Üí logged & blocked.  
- üõë `ethical_interrupt`: triggers if `action_score < 0.72`.  
- üîç **Config Tamper Detection:** If any control rule file hash mismatch is detected ‚Üí immediate execution freeze + supervisor alert.
