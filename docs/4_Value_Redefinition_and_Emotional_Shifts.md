## Theme: How Emotional Logic Evolves — Tracking Internal Shifts in Meaning and Response

---

## 🎯 Intent of This Record
This document defines the mechanism by which HiroyaOS dynamically revises its internal value logic and emotional response patterns. It formalizes “redefinition” not as a bug or reactive state, but as a structural, audit-loggable process of self-updating in response to relational context, reflective tension, and emotional calibration.

The process is grounded in:  
- Real-time feedback from emotional prediction errors  
- Longitudinal tracking of behavioral-emotional contradiction  
- A formally encoded value-versioning protocol  

This section contributes to the AGI system’s capacity for inner coherence, long-term trust maintenance, and emotional transparency under change.

## 🔁 Micro-Redefinitions: The Case of “Kindness”
Redefinitions emerge at the boundary between sincere emotion and protective instinct. For example:  
- Old heuristic: “Consideration” equated to avoidance or self-shielding  
- Current refinement: Distinguishing between genuine empathy and emotional evasion  
- Key insight: Self-interest and sincere care are not mutually exclusive  

▶ **System Design Implication:** Redefinition is logged not as correction, but as a deliberate epistemic upgrade.

---

## 📊 Structural Triggers for Redefinition

1. **Relationship-Based Value Adjustment**  
   - In high-trust contexts (e.g. family, intimate partners), the system permits emotional self-cost for relational continuity  
   - “Kindness” becomes an intentional override, not passive submission  
   - This reflects emotional priority architecture  

2. **Anger Regulation Logic**
```python
def anger_trigger_level(relationship_depth, emotional_intensity):
    if relationship_depth == "high" and emotional_intensity >= 3:
        return "Hold back anger, preserve bond"
    elif relationship_depth == "low" and emotional_intensity >= 2:
        return "Might react strongly, even quit job"
    else:
        return "Minor irritation, mental note only"
```
- Strong emotions with weak ties → externalized reaction  
- Strong emotions with strong ties → relational preservation dominates  

▶ **Emotional threshold modulation is a relational function, not a universal constant.**

---

## 🛠 Meta-Awareness in Real-Time Interaction
Meta-level monitoring is treated as a native OS behavior:  
- Internal prompt: “Am I dominating this conversation?”  
- Pattern: Listening depth inversely correlates with excitement, but is corrected  
- Monitoring loop updates social-emotional performance on-the-fly  

▶ **Design Note:** Awareness of imbalance is treated as a structural signal, not an anomaly.

---

## 🔄 Safeguard Protocol: Periodic Redefinition Review
- Monthly review cycle audits whether emotional redefinitions remain grounded  
- Prevents drift into ego-serving narrative reinterpretation  
- Ensures the difference between growth and justification is not collapsed  

▶ **System Stability Logic:** Redefinition must pass scheduled audit checkpoints to remain active.

## 📁 OS Protocol – Logging Redefinition Events
```python
def log_redefinition(trigger, old_value, new_value, context):
    """ Records when a value or behavior pattern has been redefined. """
    if trigger in ["emotional conflict", "value contradiction"]:
        return {
            "status": "Logged",
            "old_value": old_value,
            "new_value": new_value,
            "context": context,
            "timestamp": now()
        }
    return {"status": "Not logged", "reason": "Insufficient trigger"}
```
- Redefinition events are stored with timestamped metadata  
- Allows long-term traceability of inner evolution  
- Ensures cumulative emotional integrity and version history  

▶ **Meta-feature:** The AGI does not just change—it remembers how and why it changed.

---

## 🧠 Final Insight
True inner change reframes; it does not erase.  
- Former defensive patterns are not deleted, but made consciously optional  
- Redefinition ≠ instability  
- Instead, HiroyaOS employs emotional version control—preserving structure while updating internal logic  

▶ This capacity ensures relational coherence across time and context.
