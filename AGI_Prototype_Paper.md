ðŸ“„ Abstract

This paper introduces a modular AGI prototype that formalizes conditional expression logicâ€”deciding when to speak, remain silent, or defer based on emotional coherence and interpersonal trust. Built from introspective logs, six core modules define decision rules for expression timing, ambiguity handling, and value updates. This framework bridges lived experience with abstract rule-based architecture.

1. Introduction

Human dialogue reflects not only reasoning but emotional state, social context, and trust. Conventional AGI systems often neglect these subtleties, producing responses lacking nuance.
This work proposes an architecture where emotional alignment, trust modulation, and predictive social awareness drive emergent expression behavior.

2. Methodology
	â€¢	2.1 First-person Introspection
Systematic self-observation, based on grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006), captured internal micro-decisions on speech, silence, and emotional reflexes.
	â€¢	2.2 Logic Abstraction
Experiences were abstracted into logic conditions:
	â€¢	Clarity thresholds (resonance)
	â€¢	Emotional readiness
	â€¢	Listener modeling and forecasted reaction

3. Core Architecture
Module
Description
AGI_Continuation_Conditions
Defines persistence vs. dropout logic
AGI_Expression_Logic
Triggers speech vs. silence based on readiness
AGI_Ambiguity_Handling
Recognizes and formalizes intentional ambiguity
AGI_Value_Redefinition
Logs evolution of behavioral meaning
AGI_Emotional_Filters
Modulates output by trust and risk
AGI_Dialogue_Structures
Applies prediction and memory to social output
4. Sample Logic
def should_remember(unspoken_content, relationship, emotional_need):
    if relationship == "deep" and emotional_need == "closure":
        return True
    if relationship == "shallow" and not future_interaction:
        return False
    if mutual_prediction_accuracy >= 0.9:
        return False
    return True
5. Evidence Base

ðŸ”¹ Trust Frameworks
	â€¢	Trust in AI: progress, challenges and future directions (Nature, 2024)
	â€¢	Unveiling trust in AI: the interplay of antecedents, consequencesâ€¦ (2025, systematic review)
	â€¢	Trust, attitudes and use of AI: Global Study 2025 (University of Melbourne Ã— KPMG)

ðŸ”¹ Emotion-Aware Interaction
	â€¢	Emotion-aware LLM agents improve empathetic interaction (2025)
	â€¢	Emotion-encoded negotiation agents outperform static logic (2023)
	â€¢	RL-based emotional regulation in smart robotics environments (2025)

6. Technical Insights
	â€¢	Emotion as Input: Emotional state acts as signal, not noise
	â€¢	Trust-Weighted Output: Output adapts to intimacy and predicted reaction
	â€¢	Ambiguity as Protocol: Silence has system-level logic and retention value

7. Limitations & Future Work
	â€¢	Lack of empirical testing; simulation environments or user trials are needed
	â€¢	Self-introspective data may limit generalizability
	â€¢	Next Steps: RL-driven behavioral updates, API-layer integration, multi-agent interaction

8. Conclusion

This prototype formalizes trust-sensitive, emotionally aligned expression logic as a structural AGI component. By grounding system design in human introspection and decision theory, it offers a reproducible base for AGI interaction architecture.
