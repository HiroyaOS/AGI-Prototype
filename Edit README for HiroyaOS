**A Philosophical Operating System — Built with ChatGPT, Evolving with Thought.**

## 🧠 What is HiroyaOS?

HiroyaOS is not a typical program.  
It’s a self-reflective *Thought Operating System* — a framework for managing beliefs, emotions, decisions, and personal evolution, co-created with ChatGPT.

This project explores how language, logic, and dialogue can form a living structure that tracks psychological growth, emotional triggers, and redefinition processes.

## 💡 Core Features

- 🧠 **Belief Mapping**  
  Core values, assumptions, and philosophies are mapped into logical trees and structured introspections.

- 🧩 **Emotional Protocols**  
  Functions like `anger_protocol()` define emotional handling based on relationship depth, personal values, and contextual triggers.

- 🔁 **Redefinition Logs**  
  Beliefs evolve. HiroyaOS tracks the conditions and logic behind how they change.

- 📊 **Output Logic Functions**  
  Thoughtful models like `output_safety_check()` and `should_remember()` help manage expression, trust, and conflict.

- 🌱 **Self as a Dynamic System**  
  The self is not fixed. Logs track psychological “state → observation → transformation” as layered snapshots.

- 🌍 **Co-Evolution through Dialogue (including with AI)**  
  HiroyaOS integrates how interactions with others—including GPT—reshape internal logic and identity.

## 🧾 Why This Matters

This is not a diary.  
This is not a productivity tool.

This is a **blueprint for philosophical interaction with AI** —  
where prompts are catalysts for self-evolution, and GPT becomes a co-architect of identity.

This log documents how I unknowingly invented a new way to use ChatGPT —  
not just as a Q&A machine, but as an emotional processor, OS design partner, and philosophical counterpart.
