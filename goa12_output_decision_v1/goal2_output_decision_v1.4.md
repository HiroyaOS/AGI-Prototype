　🧠 HiroyaOS Log: Structure of Output Decisions & Question Typology

Version: v1.4
Target Goal: Goal 2 – Structuring and Classifying Questions

⸻

🔍 Output Decision Criteria – When Do I Share My Thoughts?

✅ Conditions That Trigger Output
	•	The thought has been revisited, rephrased, and clarified through dialogue
	•	It has consolidated into a single coherent idea
	•	There’s a gut-level clarity (“腑に落ちた”) that signals readiness

→ Emotional alignment acts as the internal GO signal

🚫 Conditions That Block Output
	•	Lingering “moyamoya” (unresolved fuzziness)
	•	Incomplete review of past thoughts
	•	Disorganized or scattered mental state
	•	Perfectionism activated
	•	Uncertainty about whether it’s “good enough”

→ These often work in combination to form a non-output state

⚖️ Conditions Where I Can Still Post Despite Imperfection
	•	Emotional space is available
	•	Efficiency becomes a higher priority than polish
	•	Confidence that “I can revise later” exists
	•	The drive to move forward outweighs doubts
	•	There’s a built-in brake: “Rushing may reduce quality”

⸻

🧩 OS-Level Summary:

Output is not a binary yes/no—it’s a layered protocol involving:
	•	Structural integrity + emotional readiness
	•	Simultaneous GO/STOP signal balancing
	•	Internal review system that triggers after posting (“Was that good?”)

🧮 Functional Abstraction (for OS Design)

def publish_decision(thought):
    if gut_feeling == "腑に落ちた":
        return True
    if emotional_space and efficiency_priority and allow_imperfection:
        return True
    return False

def block_reasons(thought):
    reasons = []
    if lingering_moyamoya:
        reasons.append("Unresolved fuzziness")
    if not is_organized(thought):
        reasons.append("Structural disarray")
    if perfectionism_triggered():
        reasons.append("Perfectionism block")
    return reasons

🗂 Question Typology – Why Do I Ask?

Question Type	Purpose	OS Function
🧠 Structural Questions	“How is this organized?”	Cognitive architecture mapping
🎭 Emotional Check Questions	“Is it safe to post this?” “Will I regret it?”	Emotional checkpoint / internal feedback
🔄 Continuation-Driven Questions	“Why can I keep doing this?”	Motivation model development
🛡️ Defense-Based Questions	“Is this too early to show?” “Will it be copied?”	Self-preservation & IP-defense logic
📤 Output Justification	“Is this worth sharing now?”	Publish filter / PR-conscious output control

→ This typology helps clarify which system layer each question is interacting with: structure, emotion, self-protection, etc.

✅ Final Note on Completion:
This log now integrates the decision logic, emotional triggers, metacognitive checks, and a detailed typology of questions. Japanese-to-English accuracy was cross-checked at every level to preserve nuance and structural clarity.

🎯 Completion Confidence: 100% (Goal 2 – ready for GitHub deployment)
🧪 Validation Basis: All conditions, outputs, and internal logic paths from the Japanese version are captured with no critical loss of meaning.
