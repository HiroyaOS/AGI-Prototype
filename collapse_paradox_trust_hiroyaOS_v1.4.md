🧠 Title:
The Pleasure of Collapse and the Paradox of Trust  
A psychological-logical record from HiroyaOS

⸻

🧩 Summary (for top of GitHub post):

This log explores the contradictory emotions tied to collapse, trust, and emotional regulation.  
Why do I sometimes want to fall apart? Why does being trusted or cared for feel uncomfortable?  
This is a deep dive into the “collapse mechanism” in HiroyaOS—where emotional safety, destruction, and attention-seeking intersect in a unique psychological structure.


⸻

🧱 Core Components:

1. 🧨 Collapse as a Form of Release
	•	I collapse not just because I’m tired, but because it grants me freedom.
　→ No job, no expectations, just stillness.
	•	There’s pleasure in being broken.
　→ I might be suffering, but there’s a weird comfort when people worry about me.
　→ I’m allowed to do nothing. It’s a rare moment of permission.
	•	Sometimes I break down so I can observe myself from the outside.
　→ It feels like watching “a me who’s finally free.”

⸻

2. ⚖️ The Trust Paradox
	•	Even when I trust someone, I keep doubting them.
　→ Doubt never really disappears, especially if the bond is strong.
	•	I don’t realize I’m avoiding trust—it’s unconscious.
　→ I avoid investing too much because the crash hurts more if it fails.
	•	When someone distances themselves, I pretend I never trusted them to begin with.
　→ Self-protection kicks in.

⸻

3. 🧠 Emotional Control & Rebound Behavior
	•	I suppress myself constantly. That builds pressure.
　→ People say: “You’re always composed, until you suddenly explode.”
	•	Collapse becomes a psychological reset.
　→ Job quitting, money spending, isolation = temporary freedom.
	•	But when others are kind to me while I’m down… it hurts.
　→ “Why are you being nice to someone this useless?”
　→ It makes me want to disappear even more.

⸻

4. 🌪️ Destruction = Control Regained?
	•	If I’m already broken, then there’s nothing left to lose.
　→ I regain control through destruction.
	•	Sometimes I push myself to collapse just to have a reason to stop.
　→ Especially when expectations feel too high.
	•	Work provides structure, so I sometimes rush to find a job after collapsing.
　→ But that cycle often repeats: apply → cancel → regret → collapse again.

⸻

5. 🪞Attention & Isolation
	•	I want people to notice, but not to interfere.
　→ Eye contact feels validating.
　→ But conversations feel invasive.
	•	Collapse is sometimes a quiet scream.
　→ “Look, I’m struggling—but don’t come too close.”
	•	I replay the past when I’m down.
　→ Driving to old neighborhoods.
　→ Watching lonely YouTubers.
　→ It gives me emotional grounding.

⸻

6. 🛑 Trust is Dangerous
	•	When people gossip or talk behind others’ backs, my trust dies instantly.
　→ “I’m probably next.”
	•	I rarely let myself fully believe in someone.
　→ If I do, and they hurt me, it redefines my whole future.
	•	To protect myself, I sometimes destroy the relationship before it gets too deep.
　→ It’s a defensive collapse.
