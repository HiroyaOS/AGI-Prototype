## 🔍 Abstract

Hallucination Firewall v1.0 proposes a **modular citation-validation** and **hallucination-mitigation** architecture for generative AI systems.  
It was inspired by a real July 2025 incident where two leading LLMs—Claude and ChatGPT—produced **conflicting assessments** about a citation (`PMC11804881`).  

- Claude initially labeled it “fatally fabricated,” but later **admitted a verification error**.  
- ChatGPT’s structural referencing was mostly consistent, despite **some metadata inaccuracies**.  

This framework draws from both systems’ behaviors to design a **reproducible, critique-aware safeguard** against citation hallucination.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 🧭 **Detect** unverifiable or fabricated references in real time (latency ≤ 200 ms)  
- 📊 **Assign confidence scores** to all source claims (`confidence_score < 0.75` → quarantine)  
- 🔁 **Log hallucination patterns** for recursive self-auditing  
- 🧠 **Enable multi-agent triangulation** (e.g., GPT vs Claude) to cross-check factuality

## 🧠 Case-Inspired Architecture

**Real-world inspiration:**

| Date       | Actor  | Initial Judgment                      | Follow-up                         |
|------------|--------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| July 2025  | Claude | "Citation is fabricated."              | "Verification error — apologies." |
| July 2025  | ChatGPT| "Structurally cited; metadata unclear."| "Caution warranted, but traceable."|

✅ **Result:** Neither model was entirely correct. One erred in judgment; the other had metadata drift.  
This firewall models **both faults**.

## ⚖️ What It Is vs What It Isn’t

| Category | Clarification |
|----------|--------------|
| ✅ What It Is | A structural prototype for citation validation, hallucination detection, and critique analysis |
| ❌ What It Is Not | A generative model fix-all or standalone hallucination eliminator |
| ⚠️ Misuse Risk | Over-trusting a single LLM’s critique; false perception of infallibility |

## 📖 Glossary

- **confidence_score**: A 0–1 numerical value indicating the trustworthiness of a citation based on reproducibility and peer review.  
- **metadata drift**: Inconsistencies between stored citation metadata and the actual source record (e.g., wrong author, incorrect DOI).  
- **peer_discrepancy_analyzer**: Module that flags disagreements between different AI agents reviewing the same source.  
- **quarantine**: Process of isolating flagged citations to prevent inclusion in final outputs until verified.  
- **latency_max_ms**: Maximum allowed processing time (in milliseconds) for a citation check to be considered valid.  
- **environment lock**: Fixing all library, interpreter, and OS package versions to ensure reproducibility across machines.

## ✅ Final Notes

- 🧠 This project does **not** claim perfect citation policing — it is a framework for reducing error propagation.
- ⚖️ Both Claude and GPT were used as **test agents** to simulate critique loops, **not** as final authorities.
- 🧬 The purpose is not to assign blame, but to **systematize mutual verification** and bias-resistant inference.
- 📌 Future versions may include:
  - Dynamic citation prompts
  - External source blacklists
  - Agent consensus ranking
