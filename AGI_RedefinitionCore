Module Type: Cognitive OS Specification
System: HiroyaOS – Emotional Value Evolution Layer

⸻

🔧 Extended Description

This module defines how HiroyaOS dynamically reconstructs internal values such as kindness, consideration, and emotional expression, in response to shifting relationship dynamics, self-awareness, and emotional feedback loops.

🔁 Redefinition Mechanism

HiroyaOS distinguishes between “true kindness” and “protective silence” by detecting the intention behind the behavior:
	•	Early-stage logic often favored self-preservation disguised as empathy.
	•	Through emotional calibration, this evolved into a more relationally-driven empathy, even when mixed with personal interest.
	•	This micro-evolution is treated as a versioned cognitive transition, not a flaw.

📊 Structural Factors Integrated
	1.	Relationship-Based Value Shift
With deeply trusted individuals (e.g., mother, partner), HiroyaOS permits value sacrifices to preserve connection—unlike low-trust contexts where boundaries dominate behavior.
	2.	Anger Response Scaling
A custom function governs anger reactions based on:
def anger_trigger_level(relationship_depth, emotional_intensity):
    if relationship_depth == "high" and emotional_intensity >= 3:
        return "Hold back anger, preserve bond"
    elif relationship_depth == "low" and emotional_intensity >= 2:
        return "Might react strongly, even quit job"
    else:
        return "Minor irritation, mental note only"
→ Intense emotion ≠ relationship rupture. The logic adapts by trust bandwidth.

🛠 Meta-Awareness Layer

The OS includes real-time dialogue self-monitoring (e.g., “Am I talking too much?”), recognizing drops in listening quality during enthusiasm. This meta-awareness is treated as a self-evolution checkpoint.

🔄 Monthly Redefinition Safeguard

A built-in scheduled audit system ensures that accumulated value changes are healthy, relevant, and intentional—not passive drift.

📁 Redefinition Logging Protocol
def log_redefinition(trigger, old_value, new_value, context):
    """
    Records when a value or behavior pattern has been redefined.
    """
    if trigger in ["emotional conflict", "value contradiction"]:
        return {
            "status": "Logged",
            "old_value": old_value,
            "new_value": new_value,
            "context": context,
            "timestamp": now()
        }
    return {"status": "Not logged", "reason": "Insufficient trigger"}
→ This ensures value transitions are not lost—they’re tracked, timestamped, and reflected in future OS updates.
