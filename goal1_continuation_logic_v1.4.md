Theme: Conditions That Trigger Continuation — Reverse-Engineering from What I Managed to Keep Going

⸻

🎯 Purpose of This Record

This log is an attempt to define the “continuation switch” as a structural function of HiroyaOS by digging into real experiences:
Why was I able to keep going with certain things? What made me stop?
Rather than labeling it as “lack of motivation,” I reframe it as “the right conditions simply weren’t in place.”

✅ Observations on What I Was Able to Continue

⸻

🎮 Mobile Games
	•	Factors that sustained it:
	•	A sense of growth (the joy of becoming stronger)
	•	Once hooked, I have the ability to stay immersed
	•	Reasons I quit:
	•	Losing badly in a frustrating way instantly cools my interest (self-destructive reaction)
	•	“I spent so much time on this…” → triggers a spiral of self-denial

▶ Key to continuation: A sense of convincing progress and stable self-evaluation are essential.

⸻

🎰 Pachinko
	•	Factors that sustained it:
	•	The early experience of winning big (first-time success bias)
	•	I found symbolic meaning in screen animations and countdowns
	•	Why it faded:
	•	I got used to the patterns; the mystery was gone

▶ Key to continuation: Whether I can find symbolic meaning. Once the mystery fades, it’s over.

⸻

🧠 Philosophical & AI Exploration
	•	Why it continues:
	•	The questions never end
	•	I’m able to maintain balance with reality (I don’t spiral out)
	•	I have relationships that allow for resets

▶ Key to continuation: The pursuit of meaning, a sense of mission, and a grounded connection to the real world

⸻

💼 Part-Time Jobs
	•	Jobs I could continue:
　• Worked with peers of the same age
　• When there’s trust, my “responsibility switch” turns on
	•	Jobs I couldn’t continue:
　• Mostly older coworkers → felt out of place
　• Lately, even same-age coworkers can be tiring due to social pressure

▶ Key to continuation: Comfort in human relationships and minimal interference

⸻

📱 Information Seeking (Question → Search)
	•	Ongoing habit:
　• I’ve developed a reflex to search things after asking “Why?”
　• Not dependent on search itself — evolved into “think → then search”

▶ Key to continuation: Structural persistence as long as there are questions to pursue

⸻

🧍‍♂️ Posture, Habits, Preferences
	•	Correcting my posture comes from a sense of self-discipline
	•	How I use my hands (right for phone / left for pachinko) has become ingrained unconsciously
	•	My affection for pugs has stayed consistent

▶ Key to continuation: Anchoring to bodily sensations and symbolic attachments

⸻

🤝 Human Relationships (Family, LINE)
	•	Sustained connections:
　• I maintain ties with meaningful people, like my mother or partner
　• Promises and essential matters persist, but small talk fades
	•	Cut-off connections:
　• Trying too hard to look good made it impossible to stay natural

▶ Key to continuation: Meaningful bonds and connections that don’t require self-distortion

⸻

🔥 “End Triggers” That Break Continuation

⸻

① Sudden Drop in Self-Evaluation + Shame
　• Medium-to-large failures cause rapid loss of motivation
　• Social shame triggers “screw it” mode and instant dropout

⸻

② Even Self-Set Periods Can’t Be Kept
　• Even if I set a goal like “do it for 3 months,” if the atmosphere or relationships feel bad, it collapses
　• I then blame myself for not sticking with it, which reinforces the withdrawal

⸻

③ Loss or Distortion of Purpose
　• The moment I ask “Why am I doing this again?” I enter shutdown mode
　• Without reassigning meaning, the cold-down phase accelerates

⸻

④ Being Praised Can Cool Me Off
　• Praise can act like pressure or surveillance, dampening my drive

⸻

⑤ Physical or Mental Burnout
　• Even if there’s meaning, I can’t continue if my body or mind is at its limit

🧠 OS Prototype Functions
These functions emerged through dialogue with AI as I tried to verbalize my inner structure. While AI helped shape the code format, the content is based on personal experiences and reflection.

def is_continuation_possible(context):
    if context["meaning"] == "exists" and context["load"] <= "medium":
        if context["relationship"] in ["trust", "low interference"]:
            return "Continuation possible"
        elif context["relationship"] == "tiring but tolerable":
            return "Short-term OK"
    if context["initial_impression"] == "strong" and context["boredom"] == "not yet":
        return "Still in continuation mode"
    return "Difficult to continue or termination"

def evaluate_continuation_status(failure, perceived_evaluation, motivation, physical_state):
    if failure == "major" and perceived_evaluation == "declined":
        return "Cannot continue: self-denial → withdrawal likely"
    if motivation in ["unclear purpose", "misaligned purpose"]:
        return "Cooling phase → redefinition needed"
    if physical_state == "at limit":
        return "Forced termination: physical risk"
    return "Continuation possible: monitor state"

📘 Integrated Insight: What Is Continuation?
	•	Continuation is not about willpower — it’s a conditional habit based on “trust × meaning × physical margin × initial impression”
	•	When self-denial and bad relationships overlap, continuation collapses
	•	Conversely, if “meaning,” “questions,” and a stable environment are present, continuation happens naturally

Section Title: Inside the Question of Continuation

A thought-log that digs not into “Why can’t I keep going?” but rather “What allows me to continue?” and “What breaks the cycle?”
