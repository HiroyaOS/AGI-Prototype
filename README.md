## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository contains the complete documentation set for the AGI Prototype, detailing the systemâ€™s cognitive-emotional architecture, communication protocols, and compliance standards.  
All documentation is **auditable**, **reproducible**, and **free of unverifiable or speculative constructs**.

The design follows a layered logic approach, integrating:

- Emotional reasoning models  
- Expression and silence protocols  
- Trust and boundary computation  
- Long-term stability and version control

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

| #  | File | Location | Description |
|----|------|----------|-------------|
| 1  | 1_Continuation_Conditions.md | `/docs` | Defines the conditions under which the system continues or halts an output sequence, integrating context, trust, and emotional thresholds. |
| 2  | 2_Output_Mechanics_and_Question_Structure.md | `/docs` | Details output sequencing, structural question handling, and dialogue management logic. |
| 3  | 3_Ambiguity_and_Boundary_Logic.md | `/docs` | Formalizes how the system interprets ambiguity, silence, and relational boundaries as functional states. |
| 4  | 4_Value_Redefinition_and_Emotional_Shifts.md | `/docs` | Describes value redefinition as a structured, logged process for emotional logic updates. |
| 5  | 5_Expression_Filters_and_Emotional_Structuring.md | `/docs` | Defines verbal expression filters, cost-benefit speech logic, and protective silence protocols. |
| 6  | 6_External_Dialogue_and_Trust_Output.md | `/docs` | Documents multi-dimensional trust-driven output logic for external communication. |
| 7  | LICENSE_Documentation.md | `/docs` | License terms (CC BY-NC 4.0) applicable to all `/docs` files. |
| 8  | Sandbox_Blueprint_Part1.md | `/docs` | **Part 1 â€“ Safety Declaration & AGI Completion Definition:** Defines architectural safety boundaries, supervised scope, core capabilities, and supervisor-gated control specifications. |
| 9  | Sandbox_Blueprint_Part2.md | `/docs` | **Part 2 â€“ Cognitive Module Specifications & Example Outputs:** Details module-level specifications, goal expansion proposal logic, external sensory interface, validation benchmarks, and representative sandboxed outputs. |
| 10 | Sandbox_Blueprint_Part3.md | `/docs` | **Part 3 â€“ Legal & Licensing Section:** Covers structural verification logic, quantitative pass/fail criteria, evidence paths, status summary, declarations, and enforceable legal restrictions. |
| 11 | Hallucination_Firewall_v1.0.md | `/` (root) | **Citation Integrity & Hallucination Detection Layer:** Modular verification framework for generative AI, with real-time citation scoring, multi-agent cross-checking, and a 5-year evidence retention policy. |
| 12 | Intention_Inference_v1.0.md | `/` (root) | **Hallucination-Free Nonverbal AGI Framework:** Deterministic, reproducible emotionâ€“intention inference system using multimodal (visual, postural, vocal) inputs, with cultural adaptation and ethics compliance. |

## ðŸ”— Cross-Reference Map

- **Sandbox Blueprint series (Parts 1â€“3)** â†’ Define the structural, operational, and legal foundation for the AGI Prototype.  
- **Documents 1â€“6** â†’ Describe emotional-cognitive logic layers and their behavioral protocols.  
- **Hallucination_Firewall_v1.0.md** â†’ Adds a dedicated layer for factual citation validation and hallucination prevention.  
- **Intention_Inference_v1.0.md** â†’ Implements hallucination-free emotional-intention reasoning from nonverbal inputs.  

Together, they form a **complete system blueprint**â€”from ethical constraints and verification mechanisms to interaction style, trust computation, and evidence-backed knowledge integrity.

## ðŸš€ Future Work

Planned documentation additions:

- **Part 4 â€“ Extended Testing & Adversarial Simulation Logs**  
- **Part 5 â€“ Interoperability & API Layer**  
- **Part 6 â€“ Ethical Impact Assessment**

## ðŸ“Œ Design Principles

- **Reproducibility** â€“ All logic is traceable and can be re-run with identical inputs.  
- **Boundary Conditions** â€“ Failure modes are explicitly encoded.  
- **Ethical Justification** â€“ All behavior is grounded in relational integrity.  
- **Third-party Verifiability** â€“ External logs and triggers are audit-ready.  
- **Cultural Clarity** â€“ Emotional terms mapped to universal models.  
- **No Hallucinated Assumptions** â€“ No unverifiable or fictional constructs.
