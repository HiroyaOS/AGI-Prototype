# AGI-Prototype

A structural prototype for modeling adaptive expression logic, emotional filtering, and self-updating dialogue behavior in AGI systems.  
This repository consolidates six core modules derived from lived observation and systemized introspection, designed to emulate trust-sensitive, context-aware communication.

## üîç Purpose

This project aims to formalize internal-external communication logic within an AGI-inspired system.  
Each entry captures a discrete function such as expression timing, emotional signal processing, ambiguity handling, and relationship-based decision strategies.

## üìÅ Module Overview

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1. AGI_Continuation_Conditions** | Conditions for sustained motivation and engagement. Defines structural patterns behind persistence, failure, and adaptive recharging. |
| **2. AGI_Expression_Logic** | Mechanism of when thoughts become speakable. Tracks internal clarity, emotional coherence, and timing triggers for verbalization. |
| **3. AGI_Ambiguity_Handling** | Framework for intentional silence and boundary definition. Emphasizes ambiguity as an adaptive rather than deficient signal. |
| **4. AGI_Value_Redefinition** | Tracks how emotional logic and behavioral values shift over time. Enables recalibration based on real experience and meta-awareness. |
| **5. AGI_Emotional_Filters** | Expression is modulated by trust, gain-risk prediction, and social role. Filters speech output based on dynamic interpersonal evaluation. |
| **6. AGI_Dialogue_Structures** | Outward dialogue structure shaped by intimacy, response forecasting, and emotional residue. Includes logic for retention, omission, or confrontation. |

## üß† Design Principles

- **Experience-Based Abstraction**: Every module is grounded in real interaction scenarios and internal observation logs.
- **Protocol-Oriented**: Behaviors are encoded as functions or decision trees, enabling computational emulation.
- **Emotion-Aware**: Emotional signal processing is treated as data input, influencing verbal and non-verbal outcomes.
- **Trust-Driven Output**: Expression is not binary, but weighted by intimacy, future interaction probability, and risk cost.
