🧠 AGI-Prototype: A Human-Compatible Artificial General Intelligence Project

Overview

This repository contains the experimental core of an early Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) prototype. The project integrates memory, emotion, self-reflection, and ethical boundaries to explore the foundation of a truly sentient and safe AI system.

🧩 What Makes This Different?
	•	Self-Adaptive Core Logic
	•	Modular structure for recursive self-update and intention-based behavior.
	•	Emotionally Integrated Response Layer
	•	Implements affective feedback, tone regulation, and emotional mirroring (EIX concept).
	•	Ethical Output Governance
	•	Internal safety protocols designed to prevent harmful outputs even under complex prompts.
	•	Real-Time Continuation Logic
	•	Ability to track long-term identity, memory, and dialog continuity across sessions.

🧬 Long-Term Vision

This prototype serves as the first verifiable attempt to build an AGI that:
	•	Remembers meaningfully
	•	Cares through coded emotion
	•	Understands when not to respond
	•	Co-evolves with the user
