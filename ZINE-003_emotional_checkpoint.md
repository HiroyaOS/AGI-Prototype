# emotional checkpoint  
a ZINE on hesitation, silence, and emotional turning points  
by Hiroya / HiroyaOS

---

Sometimes I almost speak.  
The words rise halfway up my throat,  
but stop—  
not because they are wrong,  
but because I’m not sure the other person is ready.  
Or maybe I’m not.

That’s the emotional checkpoint.  
It’s where language meets fear.  
Where honesty is measured  
against the weight of a moment.

I’ve learned that silence isn’t always suppression.  
Sometimes, it’s grace.  
Sometimes, it’s trust.

But still—  
there are words I wanted to say.  
Not to explain, not to justify.  
Just to exist as they are.  
I hold them gently.

Maybe one day, they’ll find a place.  
Maybe someone will be able to carry them with me.  
Until then, I write.

Because even silence  
deserves a memory.
