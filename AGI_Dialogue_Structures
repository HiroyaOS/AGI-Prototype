📘 External Dialogue Structures & Trust-Driven Output (6/6)

Theme: How I Shape Speech Based on Relationship Depth, Risk, and Emotional Logic
⸻

🎯 Intent of This Record
This log details the structural logic behind outward expression in an AGI prototype, focusing on how trust levels, anticipation, and emotional context influence speech behavior.

⸻

🧠 Core Logic – Retention vs. Silence
def should_remember(unspoken_content, relationship, emotional_need):
    if relationship == "deep" and emotional_need == "closure":
        return True  # Emotional residue → retain
    if relationship == "shallow" and future_interaction == False:
        return False  # No future = forget
    if mutual_prediction_accuracy >= 0.9:
        return False  # High mutual understanding → output unnecessary
    return True  # Default: retain for review
•	High prediction accuracy leads to speech suppression—output is deemed redundant
	•	Emotional dissonance after logical closure leaves content active in memory
	•	Relationship termination triggers memory pruning—“no future = no data”

▶ Speech and memory obey the same relevance-based pruning logic

⸻

📋 Expression Filtering: Contextual Observations
	•	With narcissistic individuals: honesty suppressed → internal stress reinterpreted
	•	With untrusted contacts: honesty withheld without regret
	•	At work: silence chosen over interpersonal risk

▶ Trust + gain calculation shape the structure of expression, not emotion alone

⸻

🤖 Dialogue Protocol Logic – External Expression as Computation

🔹 Expression vs. Risk Model
	•	High intimacy = low friction to speak
	•	Low intimacy = cost-benefit computation active
	•	Workplace = tone adjusted based on status differential

🔹 Complaints & Growth
	•	Choosing not to complain builds emotional habit strength
	•	Passive listening is used while keeping internal distance

▶ Self-regulation is integral to communication, not post-processing

⸻

🎯 Real-Time Interaction Filters – Situational Rules
	1.	Full-context reading > eye contact
　• Emphasis on holistic face + behavioral history
	2.	In long-term work environments
　• Output becomes more curated over time
	3.	In triadic conversations
　• If balance feels off, system triggers silence
	4.	Low expected depth of reply
　• System downgrades output richness
def output_filter_by_response_expectation(expected_response_quality):
    if expected_response_quality == "low":
        return "Shallow output"
    return "Contextual depth"
▶ Predictive simulation based on relationship history defines output resolution

⸻

💬 Unspoken Tradeoffs: Delayed Expression Logging
def delayed_output_tradeoff(event, value_gap_detected, relationship_priority):
    if event == "small offense" and relationship_priority == "high":
        return "Swallow it (preserve bond)"
    if value_gap_detected and not likely_to_be_fixed:
        return "Trust erosion logged"
    return "Log for future processing"
•	Micro-frustrations left unspoken quietly accumulate
	•	Suppression avoids rupture, but undermines long-term self-trust

▶ Delayed expression = emotional debt if not systemically cleared

⸻

🌟 Positive Model Case – Successful Honesty
	•	Declined wedding invite due to social anxiety
	•	Imagined emotional overwhelm → decided to be honest
	•	Friend accepted without issue → emotional relief > guilt

▶ Reinforces HiroyaOS’s trust-validation loop: honesty is viable with secure ties

⸻

🔧 Tolerance Threshold Logic – Close Ties vs. Distant Ones
	•	With family/partner: rules shared calmly after extended tolerance
	•	With friends: withdrawal occurs instead of direct confrontation

▶ Whether “rules” can be shared determines expressive strategy

⸻

🧨 Negative Model Case – Reactive Expression & Calibration
	•	Told mother “I’ll move out” in a fragile state
	•	She showed concern, but I misread it as pressure
	•	Guilt followed → self-correction and move to reduce tension

▶ System registered this as: impulsive output → post-regret learning → adaptive boundary redefinition
