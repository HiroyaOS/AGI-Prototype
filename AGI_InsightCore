🧠 AGI_InsightCore — Output Decision Logic & Internal Question Typology

Module Name: AGI_InsightCore
Function Type: Metacognitive Output Regulation
System: HiroyaOS – Cognitive Protocol Layer

⸻

🎯 Core Function

This module governs the AGI’s judgment process around expressing thoughts.
It reflects human-like hesitation, inner review, and readiness evaluation.
Output is not a binary yes/no—it is regulated by emotional coherence, cognitive clarity, and contextual value.

⸻

✅ Output Activation Logic

Output occurs when:
	•	Thought is refined through reflection or dialogue
	•	The idea has cohered into a single conceptual unit
	•	A gut-level signal (“腑に落ちた”) indicates internal acceptance
→ Emotional readiness × structural clarity = greenlight

⸻

🚫 Output Inhibition Conditions

Output is blocked when:
	•	Residual fuzziness (“moyamoya”) is present
	•	Mental structure remains fragmented or chaotic
	•	Perfectionism or fear of imperfection is active
	•	Doubts remain about timing or necessity
→ These combine into a non-output state

⸻

⚖️ Imperfect Output Threshold

Output proceeds under imperfection if:
	•	Emotional energy is sufficient
	•	Priority is placed on efficiency over polish
	•	“I can revise later” logic is accepted
	•	Progress drive > perfection hesitation
	•	Self-brake gently cautions without halting flow

💻 System Logic Functions (OS Prototype Code)
def publish_decision(thought):
    if gut_feeling == "ready" and is_structured(thought):
        return True
    if emotional_space and efficiency_mode and allow_imperfection:
        return True
    return False

def block_reasons(thought):
    reasons = []
    if lingering_moyamoya:
        reasons.append("Fuzziness unresolved")
    if not is_organized(thought):
        reasons.append("Fragmented structure")
    if perfectionism_triggered():
        reasons.append("Perfectionism block")
    return reasons
🗂 Internal Question Typology
Type
Core Intent
System Layer
🧠 Structural Questions
“How is this organized?”
Architecture mapping
🎭 Emotional Check Questions
“Am I ready to share this now?”
Emotional readiness calibration
🔄 Continuation Logic
“Why am I still doing this?”
Persistence tracking
🛡️ Defense Filters
“Will this be misunderstood or copied?”
Risk + IP protection layer
📤 Output Justification
“Is this worth publishing at this moment?”
Temporal utility / PR sensitivity
→ Each question acts as a diagnostic node in the self-assessment loop.

	•	Filters premature output via metacognitive checks
	•	Identifies the function and layer of each question in real time
