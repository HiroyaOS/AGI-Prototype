“Things I meant, but never landed.”

⸻

There are moments when I say everything right—
and yet, it still lands wrong.
Not because the words were flawed,
but because the space between us wasn’t ready.

I replay it later.
That one phrase.
That slight hesitation in their eyes.
The pause too long to ignore.

I didn’t mean to sound cold.
I didn’t mean to push them away.
I just… didn’t know how else to say it.

And then comes the echo:
“Maybe if I had said it like this instead…”
But the moment is gone.
And now it lives only in my chest,
folded in a thousand silent rewrites.

⸻

Some truths don’t break through when forced.
Some meanings are too fragile for direct impact.
Sometimes, what matters most
isn’t the sentence,
but the safety of being misunderstood
without punishment.

⸻

I’m still learning that.
How to hold what I feel
without dropping it on someone else’s heart.
