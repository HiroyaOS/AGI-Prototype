🔍 Abstract

Hallucination Firewall v1.1 proposes a modular citation-validation and hallucination-mitigation architecture for generative AI systems. It was inspired by a real July 2025 event where two leading LLMs—Claude and ChatGPT—produced conflicting assessments about a citation (PMC11804881). Claude initially labeled it “fatally fabricated,” but later admitted a verification error. Meanwhile, ChatGPT’s structural referencing was mostly consistent, despite a few metadata inaccuracies. This framework draws from both systems’ behaviors to design a reproducible, critique-aware safeguard against citation hallucination.

🎯 Project Objective

To structurally reinforce citation integrity by:
	•	🧭 Detecting unverifiable or fabricated references in real time
	•	📊 Assigning confidence scores to all source claims
	•	🔁 Logging hallucination patterns for recursive self-auditing
	•	🧠 Enabling multi-agent triangulation (e.g., GPT vs Claude) to cross-check factuality

🧠 Case-Inspired Architecture

In response to the July 2025 incident:

Claude: “This citation is fabricated.”
GPT: “It structurally exists with metadata errors.”
Claude (later): “Verification mistake acknowledged.”

…a layered architecture was formulated:
HallucinationFirewall_v1.0:
  layers:
    - citation_validator:
        type: PubMedVerifier
        function: Cross-checks DOI/PMC/ArXiv metadata integrity
    - confidence_filter:
        type: ReferenceScoring
        function: Assigns 0–1 confidence based on reproducibility & peer review
    - hallucination_logger:
        type: RecursionTracer
        function: Stores paths of unverifiable outputs
    - peer_discrepancy_analyzer:
        type: MultiAgentVerifier
        function: Cross-validates LLMs to flag disagreement
    - suppression_gate:
        type: TrustCutoff
        function: Flags or blocks low-confidence claims
  flags:
    - hallucination_suspect: true
    - peer_disagreement: logged
    - citation_error_trace: retained

⚖️ What It Is vs What It Isn’t
Category
Clarification
✅ What It Is
A structural prototype for citation validation, hallucination detection, and critique analysis
❌ What It Is Not
A generative model fix-all or standalone hallucination eliminator
⚠️ Misuse Risk
Over-trusting a single LLM’s critique; false perception of infallibility
🔐 Safety & Ethics Features
	•	📜 All citations are auditable with trace logs
	•	🤝 Supports GPT–Claude cross-validation
	•	🧩 Fully modular; can operate domain-agnostically
	•	🟡 Outputs with flagged citations are automatically quarantined

Follow-up
July 2025
Claude
“Citation is fabricated.”
“Verification error—apologies.”
July 2025
ChatGPT
“Structurally cited; metadata unclear.”
“Caution warranted, but traceable.”
✅ Result: Neither model was completely correct. One erred in judgment; the other had metadata drift. This firewall models both faults.

✅ Final Notes
	•	🧠 This project does not claim perfect citation policing—it is a framework for reducing error propagation.
	•	⚖️ Both Claude and GPT were used as test agents to simulate critique loops, not as final authorities.
	•	🧬 The purpose is not to assign blame, but to systematize mutual verification and bias-resistant inference.
	•	📌 Future versions may include dynamic citation prompts, external source blacklists, and agent consensus ranking.
